    "One of the biggest challanges I have faced while analysing selected dataset was the fact that its highly imbalanced dataset, running supervised and unsupervised learning techniques raised many difficulties such as:\n",
    "1. Dataset is biased towards majority class so it requires balancing.\n",
    "2. Balancing it before train_test split causes feature leakage where in case SMOTE is used same data points could be available in both test and train sets which causes high accuracy while model is not learning at all.\n",
    "3. Ofcourse there is universal rule, to split test_train first then balance train sets, but this wont work well if imbalance ratio is very high such 1:1000 perhabs, I have noticed that even though model is trained on balanced tran dataset when introduced to imbalanced test set it gets highly biased towards majority class.\n",
    "4. There is also metrics factor, selecting best metrics to measure model  is key in finding weather model is learning what we want it to learn or not."
